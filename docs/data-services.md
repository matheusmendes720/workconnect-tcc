# Data and Services

This document provides a detailed overview of the data and services used in the Work Connect application. It covers the mock data generation, the service layer, and the API integration.

## Mock Data Generation

The application uses a mock data generator to provide a realistic and consistent dataset for development and testing. The mock data is generated by the `MockDataEstoque` class, located in `src/lib/estoque/mock-data.ts`.

-   **Purpose**: To provide a rich and varied dataset that covers all the features of the application.
-   **Implementation**: The `MockDataEstoque` class generates a set of products, categories, suppliers, and other data entities, using a combination of random data and pre-defined templates.
-   **Usage**: The mock data is used to initialize the `useStockData` hook, which provides the application's state.

## Service Layer

The service layer is responsible for handling all communication with external APIs and data sources. It provides a clean and consistent interface for the rest of the application to interact with the data.

-   **Purpose**: To abstract the details of the data sources and to provide a centralized location for all data-related logic.
-   **Structure**: The service layer is organized into a set of services, each responsible for a specific data entity. The main service is the `DatabaseService`, located in `src/lib/estoque/services/database-service.ts`.
-   **Implementation**: The `DatabaseService` provides a set of methods for fetching, saving, and syncing data with a remote database. It is designed to be easily adaptable to different database technologies.

## API Integration

The application is designed to be easily integrated with a variety of external APIs. The service layer provides a flexible and extensible architecture that can be adapted to different API specifications.

-   **Purpose**: To allow the application to connect to external data sources and to extend its functionality with third-party services.
-   **Implementation**: The API integration is handled by the service layer, which provides a set of services for interacting with external APIs. These services are designed to be modular and can be easily replaced or extended.
